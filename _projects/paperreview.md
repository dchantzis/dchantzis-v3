This is my dissertation project for the BSc(Hons) in Informatics Engineering at the Department of Information Technology, Thessaloniki, Greece.

A Web application for the review and administration of the submission process of conference papers.

This application also demonstrates ways of securing a web application according to the instructions provided by the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) community and carefully designed algorithms.
