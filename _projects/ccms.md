This is a semester project participating in the "Applications Development & Management" class for the BSc(Hons) in Informatics Engineering at the Department of Information Technology, Thessaloniki, Greece.

A very simple system that uses the Swing library of Java.

This system manages the ticket reservations of a cinema where customers can:
- reserve any number of seats for a movie.
- cancel their reservations.
- buy tickets of their reserved seats.
- buy tickets on the spot without reservations depending on the availability of the seats.

[Note: All the project documents are in Greek.]
