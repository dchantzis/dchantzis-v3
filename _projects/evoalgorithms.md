Semester project participating in the "Intelligent Systems" class for the BSc(Hons) in Informatics Engineering at the Department of Information Technology, Thessaloniki, Greece.

Evolutionary algorithm that deals with the problem of moving a number of files from one hard drive to another and achieving the lowest free disk space in that hard drive (maximizing the number of moved files).

[Note: All the project documents are in Greek.]
