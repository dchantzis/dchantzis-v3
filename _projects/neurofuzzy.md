This is a semester project participating in the "Intelligent Systems" class for the BSc(Hons) in Informatics Engineering at the Department of Information Technology, Thessaloniki, Greece.

Implementation of a neuro-fuzzy system for iris classification.
The objective of this paper is to provide its readers with information regarding the basic principles and concepts of a basic neurofuzzy system and the ANFIS model. The last chapter includeds a detailed description of how to develop a neuro-fuzzy classifier for the classification of an iris(plant) family.
