I did the Illustration for a laser-engraved design on a banboo iPhone 5 case.

The illustration features some of Spartans war gear. I used reference pictures from real Spartan artifacts and also studied some props from the "300" movie.

The finished illustration design file was sent to the Groove website and they took care of the producing case and engraving.
